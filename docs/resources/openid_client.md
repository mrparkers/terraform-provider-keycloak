# keycloak\_openid\_client Resource

Allows for creating and managing Keycloak clients that use the OpenID Connect protocol.

Clients are entities that can use Keycloak for user authentication. Typically,
clients are applications that redirect users to Keycloak for authentication
in order to take advantage of Keycloak's user sessions for SSO.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "keycloak_realm" "realm" {
  realm   = "my-realm"
  enabled = true
}

resource "keycloak_openid_client" "openid_client" {
  realm_id            = keycloak_realm.realm.id
  client_id           = "test-client"

  name                = "test client"
  enabled             = true

  access_type         = "CONFIDENTIAL"
  valid_redirect_uris = [
    "http://localhost:8080/openid-callback"
  ]

  login_theme = "keycloak"

  extra_config = {
    "key1" = "value1"
    "key2" = "value2"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

- `realm_id` - (Required) The realm this client is attached to.
- `client_id` - (Required) The Client ID for this client, referenced in the URI during authentication and in issued tokens.
- `name` - (Optional) The display name of this client in the GUI.
- `enabled` - (Optional) When `false`, this client will not be able to initiate a login or obtain access tokens. Defaults to `true`.
- `description` - (Optional) The description of this client in the GUI.
- `access_type` - (Required) Specifies the type of client, which can be one of the following:
  - `CONFIDENTIAL` - Used for server-side clients that require both client ID and secret when authenticating.
      This client should be used for applications using the Authorization Code or Client Credentials grant flows.
  - `PUBLIC` - Used for browser-only applications that do not require a client secret, and instead rely only on authorized redirect
      URIs for security. This client should be used for applications using the Implicit grant flow.
  - `BEARER-ONLY` - Used for services that never initiate a login. This client will only allow bearer token requests.
- `client_secret` - (Optional) The secret for clients with an `access_type` of `CONFIDENTIAL` or `BEARER-ONLY`. This value is sensitive and should be treated with the same care as a password. If omitted, this will be generated by Keycloak.
- `client_authenticator_type` - (Optional) Defaults to `client-secret`. The authenticator type for clients with an `access_type` of `CONFIDENTIAL` or `BEARER-ONLY`. A default Keycloak installation will have the following available types:
  - `client-secret` (Default) Use client id and client secret to authenticate client.
  - `client-jwt` Use signed JWT to authenticate client. Set signing algorithm in `extra_config` with `attributes.token.endpoint.auth.signing.alg = <alg>`
  - `client-x509` Use x509 certificate to authenticate client. Set Subject DN in `extra_config` with `attributes.x509.subjectdn = <subjectDn>`

- `valid_post_logout_redirect_uris` - (Optional) A list of valid URIs a browser is permitted to redirect to after a successful logout.

- `backchannel_logout_session_required` - (Optional) When `true`, a sid (session ID) claim will be included in the logout token when the backchannel logout URL is used. Defaults to `true`.
- `backchannel_logout_revoke_offline_sessions` - (Optional) Specifying whether a "revoke_offline_access" event is included in the Logout Token when the Backchannel Logout URL is used. Keycloak will revoke offline sessions when receiving a Logout Token with this event.
- `extra_config` - (Optional) A map of key/value pairs to add extra configuration attributes to this client. This can be used for custom attributes, or to add configuration attributes that are not yet supported by this Terraform provider. Use this attribute at your own risk, as it may conflict with top-level configuration attributes in future provider updates. For example, the `extra_config` map can be used to set Authentication Context Class Reference (ACR) to Level of Authentication (LoA) mapping
	``` hcl
	extra_config = {
    "acr.loa.map" = "{\"normal\":\"1\",\"transfer\":\"2\"}"
  	}
	```

- `import` - (Optional) When `true`, the client with the specified `client_id` is assumed to already exist, and it will be imported into state instead of being created. This attribute is useful when dealing with clients that Keycloak creates automatically during realm creation, such as `account` and `admin-cli`. Note, that the client will not be removed during destruction if `import` is `true`.

## Attributes Reference

- `service_account_user_id` - (Computed) When service accounts are enabled for this client, this attribute is the unique ID for the Keycloak user that represents this service account.
- `resource_server_id` - (Computed) When authorization is enabled for this client, this attribute is the unique ID for the client (the same value as the `.id` attribute).

## Import

Clients can be imported using the format `{{realm_id}}/{{client_keycloak_id}}`, where `client_keycloak_id` is the unique ID that Keycloak
assigns to the client upon creation. This value can be found in the URI when editing this client in the GUI, and is typically a GUID.

Example:

```bash
terraform import keycloak_openid_client.openid_client my-realm/dcbc4c73-e478-4928-ae2e-d5e420223352
```
