# keycloak\_group\_memberships Resource

Allows for managing a Keycloak group's members.

Note that this resource attempts to be an **authoritative** source over group members. When this resource takes control
over a group's members, users that are manually added to the group will be removed, and users that are manually removed
from the group will be added upon the next run of `terraform apply`.

Also note that you should not use `keycloak_group_memberships` with a group has been assigned as a default group via
`keycloak_default_groups`.

This resource **should not** be used to control membership of a group that has its members federated from an external
source via group mapping.

To non-exclusively manage the group's of a user, see the [`keycloak_user_groups` resource][1]

This resource paginates its data loading on refresh by 50 items.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "keycloak_realm" "realm" {
  realm   = "my-realm"
  enabled = true

  name     = "my-group"
}

resource "keycloak_user" "user" {
  realm_id = keycloak_realm.realm.id
  username = "my-user"
}

resource "keycloak_group_memberships" "group_members" {
  realm_id = keycloak_realm.realm.id
  group_id = keycloak_group.group.id

    keycloak_user.user.username
  ]
